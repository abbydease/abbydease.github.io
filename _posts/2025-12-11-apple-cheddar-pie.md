I had never been more excited to make a pie than I was when I discovered this recipe on (Claire Saffitz's Youtube Channel)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvHllD5iFKc&t=1674s] and had a trip to the mountains of North Carolina lined within the span of a week. I'm not one to really bake pies outside of the holidays (with the exception of a rhubarb pie this past summer) but the promise of freshly picked apples was too good to pass up. And I can honestly say I have never put more effort into a pie because I so desperately wanted this one to turn out. What I was left with, however, was a gorgeous, impressive pie that I didn't love.

Don't get me wrong, the flavor combination in this pie is genius -- I just could not get behind it for some reason. The pie is a rich, decadent display of flavor that just didn't quite strike my taste buds in the way that I had been imagining in the week leading up to its creation. It has all the components, techniques, and stage presence of a pie that will definitely intrigue: caramelized cream, a bubbling, flaky cheese crust, and is densely packed with apples for the perfect slice. I do think most people would like this, and my family seemed to enjoy it, but there was something severely wrong with *me* that made this experience less than stellar.

Claire recommends Kerry Gold Dubliner cheese for this recipe, which is delicious by itself. It's less sharp and comes off more so as a parmesan-cheddar crossover, with the nuttiness to back it up. For the "cheddar" aspect of the apple cheddar pie, you remove some of the butter volume from Claire's All-Butter Flaky Pie Dough and replace it with the grated cheddar, working it into the flour to a coarse crumb, and bringing the dough together with a little bit of water. I found this crust to be even easier to work with than a typical all-butter dough. The cheese, because of its high fat content, makes the dough less sticky and it comes together very easily, barely sticking to the surface when rolling. I definitely forgot the extra lamination step (as usual) but it still delivered a flaky texture with the added complexity of the cheese. I also probably made the most gorgeous lattice of my life; there was no cracking or dry spots or necessary patchwork. To balance some of the savory flavor in the crust, you brush the crust with egg wash and sprinkle generously with demerara sugar. This is something I generally do with apple pies, but it is definitely a step I would recommend for this pie.

This filling is phenomenal, but very, very messy. I used three pounds of pink lady apples for the filling so that I could really pack the apple slices in and reduce any potential gaps. I don't know if this was any different from my usual apple-pie-baking quantities or techniques, but I was left with a far stickier mess. I baked the pie on a foil-lined sheet tray (thank goodness), but unfortunately had to deal with a very sticky caramel that seeped out through the lattice and left the bottom of my pie plate a bit difficult to clean. All in all, it was worth it, but it was not the most eye-pleasing presentation. They say you can clean the bottom of the pie plate after removing it from the sheet tray, but I wouldn't say getting up underneath a pie to wipe hardened caramel off the bottom is the easiest task in the world. I ended up just kind of leaving it and wrapping the whole pie in foil to not make a mess in the fridge.

The crust, once baked, becomes pleasantly golden with darker burnt sections from the cheese. It really is a gorgeous pie that, while perhaps technically a little more advanced, comes together really nicely. I would make it again, but I would probably serve it to someone other than myself. I so badly want to love this pie, but it was not for me and I offer my sincerest apologies to Claire and everyone involved. It is delicious, complex, and unique, but I could barely my second slice leftover. It is highly possible that this is one of those pies that tastes better during the day. Eating this after dinner may have been my downfall, when this is something rich that would probably taste amazing with an iced (or hot) coffee. I think I was just needing a little something to balance me out in terms of flavor. But I do highly recommend this recipe and enjoyed making it. Maybe pick the apples yourself too.
