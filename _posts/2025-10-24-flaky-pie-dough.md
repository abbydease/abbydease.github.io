## All-Butter Flaky Pie Dough

**Ingredients:**
- 1 stick plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose floud
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt

**Prepare the ice water and butter:**
Fill a liquid measuring cup with about 1 cup of water and ice and refrigerate it while you assemble the dough. Cut half of the butter into 1/8-inch-thick slices, and half into small, 1/2-inch cubes. Keep butter cold in fridge or freezer while you prepare the dry ingredients.

**Mix the dry ingredients:**
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt to combine.

**Work the butter into the dry ingredients:**
Remove cubed butter from the fridge and toss in the flour mixture to coat. Quickly and firmly use your fingertips to smash the butter into small pieces, no larger than a pea. Remove the butter slices from the fridge and toss in the flour mixture to coat. Flatten the butter pieces between your thumbs and fingertips into thin sheets/irregular shards. Once you've worked in all the butter, you should have a very coarse, slightly yellowed mixture that somewhat resembles cornmeal with some larger pieces of butter here and there.

**Bring the dough together:**
Slowly drizzle about 5 tablespoons of the ice water (avoiding any ice) into the mixture, tossing with a fork as you go. Switch to your hands to bring the dough together inside the bowl until shaggy pieces form. Knead the mixture a few times (the dough will be clumpy with a few dry bits). Line the work surface with a sheet of plastic wrap and transfer the large clumps of dough from the bowl to the plastic. To the remaining dry bits in the bowl, add water one teaspoon at a time, tossing with a fork until very few dry spots remain. Add this dough to the large clumps already on the work surface and bring everything together. 

**Wrap and chill the dough**
Roughly form the dough into a 3/4-inch-thick square, then wrap tightly in the plastic. Press out any air and press down on the dough with the heel of your hand to flatten and further force the dough into the corners of the plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least two hours and up to three days. 

**Roll out and fold the dough:**
Unwrap the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and use a rolling pin to beat the dough across the surface to increase its pliability. Dust the dough with flour and roll it out, dusting with more flour as needed.

**To blind bake:**
Once pie dough is formed into pie plate, freeze the plate for about 10 minutes. Then, prick the bottom of the pastry with the tines of a fork in several places to prevent puffing. Line the inside of the plate with foil and use pie weights, dried beans, or rice. Place pie plate onto a baking sheet. Bake in the center of a 425°F oven until the edge of the crust is set and starting to turn golden when you peek under the foil, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and lift foil and pie weights out of crust. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F and bake another 20 to 25 minutes for a parbaked crust or 30 to 35 minutes for a fully baked crust.

**Notes:**
This recipe is from Claire Saffitz's *Dessert Person*. In her recipe, she advises you to do an envelope-style lamination of the dough after the initial chill and rolling of the dough to increase flakiness. I have done both with and without (mostly due to forgetting about this step entirely) and it came out fine, if not lowkey the same. But to follow this step, just use a basic lamination technique, folding thirds onto each other like folding a letter to fit into an envelope, and roll out. Wrap the dough back up and rest an additional 30 minutes in the fridge following lamination before the final rolling out of the dough. If you skip the lamination step, you can just straight roll it out and prepare the pie plate after the initial two hours. But this crust is amazing!! The best I have tried in my many years of pie-baking and gets lots of positive feedback from my family!
